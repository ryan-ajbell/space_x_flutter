# SpaceX Explorer üöÄ

<img src="assets/readme/spacex_banner.svg" alt="SpaceX Explorer Banner" width="100%" />

A polished Flutter application that lets you explore SpaceX rockets and launches using a clean, testable architecture (Clean Architecture + Feature-first structure) with BLoC/Cubit state management. Designed as an educational yet production-minded reference for layering, dependency inversion, and UI composition.

---
## ‚ú® Highlights
- Clean, layered architecture (Domain / Data / Presentation / Feature modules)
- Reactive state management with `flutter_bloc` (Cubits)
- Dependency Injection via `get_it` (see `injection_container.dart`)
- Theming + dark space aesthetic (see `presentation/theme/space_theme.dart`)
- Extensible feature grouping under `lib/features/`
- Separation of DTOs vs domain Entities
- Reusable widgets (`presentation/widgets`) for cards and layout
- Route-based navigation with custom full-screen dialogs
- Ready for multi-platform (iOS, Android, Web, Desktop) ‚Äì Flutter project scaffold provided
- Clearly defined result handling (`core/result.dart`) for error-safe flows

## üß© Architecture (Clean + Feature-first)
This project blends Clean Architecture boundaries with a pragmatic feature directory:

- Domain Layer: Pure business logic, no Flutter dependencies. Contains entities (immutable), repository interfaces, and use cases (application-specific actions). Test-friendly and framework-agnostic.
- Data Layer: Implements repository interfaces, handles API calls, maps DTOs to domain entities, and deals with error translation. Knows about external services but never leaks them outward.
- Presentation Layer: Flutter widgets + Cubits (BLoC) orchestrating UI state. Consumes domain use cases via DI.
- Feature Modules: Group together related presentation + cubits + minor adapters for better scaling.

### Dependency Flow
```
UI Widgets / Pages --> Cubits (State) --> Usecases --> Repositories (Abstract) --> Data Repositories (Concrete) --> API / Remote
```
Only arrows downward; no upward knowledge. Interfaces break cycles.

## üõ† Tech Stack
- Flutter (UI, cross-platform)
- Dart (Language)
- `flutter_bloc` (State management)
- `get_it` (Service locator / DI)
- SpaceX Public REST API (Remote data source)

---
## üöÄ Getting Started
### 1. Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK installed (stable channel)
- Dart >= constraint in `pubspec.yaml`
- iOS: Xcode & CocoaPods; Android: Android Studio + SDKs

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Run
```bash
# iOS Simulator
flutter run -d ios

# Android Emulator
flutter run -d android

# Web (Chrome)
flutter run -d chrome
```

### 4. Hot Reload / Restart
Use Flutter tooling or IDE shortcuts to iterate rapidly.

## üß™ Testing Strategy (Suggested)
While only a sample test (`test/widget_test.dart`) may exist right now, the architecture supports deep testing:
- Domain: Pure Dart unit tests for usecases & entities
- Data: Mock API adapters; verify mapping & error handling
- Presentation: Cubit tests using `bloc_test` (state emission sequences)
- Widget: Golden tests for consistent UI rendering

Add packages:
```bash
flutter pub add dev:bloc_test dev:mocktail dev:flutter_test
```

Example (pseudo):
```dart
blocTest<RocketsCubit, RocketsState>(
  'emits loaded when repository succeeds',
  build: () => RocketsCubit(mockGetRocketsUsecase),
  act: (cubit) => cubit.load(),
  expect: () => [isA<RocketsLoading>(), isA<RocketsLoaded>()],
);
```

---
## üîå Dependency Injection
Centralized in `injection_container.dart`:
- Registers usecases
- Registers repository implementations against abstract types
- Registers Cubits for retrieval via `sl<T>()`

Keeps construction logic decoupled from consumers.

---
## üì¶ Result & Error Handling
`core/result.dart` standardizes success/error flows:
- Prevents throwing exceptions across layers
- Encourages explicit success/failure pattern matching

Example pattern:
```dart
final result = await usecase();
result.when(
  success: (data) => emit(State.loaded(data)),
  failure: (err) => emit(State.error(err.message)),
);
```

---
## üé® UI / Theming
`SpaceTheme.build()` defines consistent colors, typography, and dark styling suitable for a space exploration context. Widgets like `RocketCard` and `LaunchCard` present domain entities in a succinct, reusable format.

Starfield / space background effects can be extended with custom painters or animated widgets for more flair.

---
## üîÑ Navigation
`MaterialApp.onGenerateRoute` in `main.dart` provides typed, argument-based routing:
- `/rocket` -> `RocketDetailPage`
- `/launch` -> `LaunchDetailPage`
- `/rocket_full` & `/launch_full` -> Fullscreen card experiences

Feature modules could supply their own route registration for scaling.

---
## üß± Extending Features
1. Create new folder in `features/` (e.g., `missions/`)
2. Add Cubit + states + pages
3. Add usecases in domain layer
4. Add repository contracts & implementations
5. Register everything in `injection_container.dart`
6. Add navigation route(s)

---
## üß≠ Roadmap / Ideas
- Offline caching layer (Hive / SQLite)
- Error boundary widget + retries
- Search & filtering for launches/rockets
- Favorites persistence
- Light theme variant
- CI workflow (GitHub Actions) for tests + formatting
- Golden tests for design locking

---
## ü§ù Contributing
1. Fork & create a feature branch
2. Follow existing folder conventions
3. Add/Update tests for new logic
4. Run `dart format .` and ensure analyzer passes
5. Open a PR with a concise summary & screenshots if UI-related
